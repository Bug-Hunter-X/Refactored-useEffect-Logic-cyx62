# Incorrect Conditional Logic in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook where the conditional logic within the effect doesn't correctly handle the initial state or edge cases, leading to unexpected behavior.  The bug involves an incorrect conditional check that causes the effect to trigger when it shouldn't.  The solution provides the correct logic to address this issue.

## Bug

The bug lies in the `useEffect` hook of `MyComponent`. The intention is to log a message when the `count` is greater than 0. However, the condition `if (count)` is problematic.  In JavaScript, 0 is considered falsy, so the message won't log when `count` is 0, even though the count is updated in the state when the button is clicked, the `useEffect` hook doesn't accurately capture that information, leading to inconsistent behavior.

## Solution

The solution modifies the conditional logic within the `useEffect` hook to explicitly check if `count` is greater than 0 using `if (count > 0)`. This ensures the effect only triggers when the count is indeed greater than 0, fixing the inconsistent behavior. This small change provides a more robust way to manage the state update.
